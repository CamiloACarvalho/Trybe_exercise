    <h3>A little bit about my coding journey until now:</h3>

    <p>
        Everything started in 2010 when I began my journey at UFJF. 
        During this time, I had my first contact with algorithms, and I fell in love with them. 
        I dedicated myself to studying extensively, and I achieved success in my endeavors. 
        Throughout my academic journey, I explored various programming languages. 
        However, it wasn't until 2022 that I made the pivotal decision to transition into the field of development.
    </p>

    <p>
        I embarked on a path to study software engineering at Ampli, but I found that it didn't align with my aspirations. 
        It was during this time that a friend introduced me to Trybe. Intrigued, I began researching about Trybe and its offerings, 
        and I discovered a wealth of opportunities and possibilities. With newfound excitement, I decided to join Trybe and dive into the world of programming. 
        And here I am today!
